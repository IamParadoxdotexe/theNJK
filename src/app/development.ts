    work: 'I lead the sole development of this web app as the final special feature for a prototype Java application in CS 3733 Software Engineering. Acting as Lead Software Engineer of a 9-person Scrum team, I spent our final week-long sprint developing the Flask-based web app using Material Design Lite components. I also connected the app with our remote MongoDB database and enabled push notifications through the Push API.'

The website also allows users to search for players by their in-game name to view more in-depth statistics.',
    work: 'I developed PUBG Power as a personal side project to flesh out my web development skills. I used Python Flask to easily host the website and interact with both the PUBG API (to fetch player statistics) and a remote MongoDB database (to store peristent player and leaderboard data). For the front-end, I used basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript.'

Using Brigham and Women’s Faulkner Hospital as a model, the app allows for orders to the on-site cafeteria and Starbucks. There is also built-in functionality for employees to assign, deny, and complete orders.',
    work: 'As Lead Software Engineer of a 9-person Scrum team, I lead the design and development of this app and API for a prototype, Java application. During a single week-long sprint, I built the app in Java using JavaFX and connected a local Apache Derby database. I also created an API such that any other JavaFX app could easily integrate it.'

    work: 'Over a 9-week iterative process, I met with the Bio-CS Bridge team and a group of teachers to design the structure and layout of this platform. I used Photoshop to mock up my designs and continuously applied feedback that I received. After we reached a design everyone was happy with, I developed the platform framework in Angular.'
