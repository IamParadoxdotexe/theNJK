  caption="Despite my passion for technical code development, I don't mind getting my hands dirty in the world of digital design.
  I am by no means an artist, but I have an eye for what looks good and what users would think is functional, yet attractive.
  I have integrated this perspective with how I design websites, games, logos, and social content to create my own digital works of art."
